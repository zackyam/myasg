The best number of clusters is:  5
All 4 socres are the highest among all clusters 
As we loop the centers for 1000 times for 000 data, we will get close to the true centers
The ARI and v-measure score are close to 0.9, which our prediction is very close to the true clusters.
The MRI score also highest at 1.4
the silhouette coefficient was highest when k = 5, suggesting 5 is the optimal number of clusters.
